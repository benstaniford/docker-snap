## ✅ Global Functions (Required for onclick handlers)
- [x] navigateToFolder() - exposed by ui-controls.js
- [x] showFullscreen() - exposed by fullscreen.js
- [x] showVideo() - exposed by fullscreen.js

## ✅ Initialization Order
- [x] config.js loads first (provides global state)
- [x] ui-controls.js (depends on config)
- [x] slideshow.js (depends on config)

- [x] gallery-loader.js (depends on config)
- [x] app.js (coordinates initialization)

## ✅ Cross-Module Communication
- [x] Shared global state via galleryConfig

- [x] Proper dependency management
- [x] Error handling and fallbacks

## Summary

**Original file:** 770 lines, single monolithic file
**New structure:** 5 focused modules + initialization script
- config.js: 32 lines (configuration & state)
- ui-controls.js: 108 lines (UI controls & navigation)  
- slideshow.js: 189 lines (slideshow functionality)
- fullscreen.js: 174 lines (fullscreen & individual viewing)
- gallery-loader.js: 152 lines (API calls & gallery loading)
- app.js: 67 lines (initialization & testing)

**Total:** 722 lines across 6 files (48 lines less due to elimination of duplication)

✅ **All functionality preserved and properly modularized**
